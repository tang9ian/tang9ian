### Hi there, I am Charles Tang, a full-stack developer, I'm a tech enthusiast who's found a sweet spot in the world of coding, specializing in both Java and ColdFusion. With Java, I love diving into the nitty-gritty of backend development, crafting elegant algorithms and functionalities. On the flip side, ColdFusion lets me whip up dynamic web applications with a touch of simplicity and flair. I'm all about finding the perfect balance between these two worlds to create software that's both powerful and user-friendly. Currently, I also am learning the Golang stack, and focusing on frontend frameworks or libraries.


#### If you have some CFML legacy systems that require maintenance, Please do not hesitate to contact me at tang9ian at gmail.com.
